Neural Network for Predicting Student Loan Repayment
Overview
This project focuses on creating a machine learning model to predict student loan repayment success. It utilizes a dataset containing information about previous student loan recipients and employs deep learning techniques to forecast the likelihood of loan repayment. This endeavor aims to assist a student loan refinancing company in offering more accurate interest rates based on predicted repayment probabilities.
